	/// Presents a modal view that shows the currently active charge session, if there is one.
	///
	/// You can use this view modifier to control the presentation of an already active charge session
	/// in your app.
	///
	/// - Note: You can open this view at any time. However, if there is no active charge session,
	/// it will show a "no active charge session" info.
	/// - Tip: Call ``ChargeSession/updates()`` to receive status updates about active charge
	/// sessions in your app. For example, you can use that information to offer a "Show active
	/// charge session" button in your app that triggers the presentation of the active charge
	/// session.
	/// - Important: This modifier requires iOS 16.0 or later. On earlier versions, it does nothing to
	/// the wrapped view.
	/// - Parameter isPresented: A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the
	/// active charge session.
	/// - Returns: A view that presents a charge session view if the `isPresented` binding is set to
	/// `true`.
