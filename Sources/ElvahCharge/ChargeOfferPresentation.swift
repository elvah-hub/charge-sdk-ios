	/// - Important: This modifier requires iOS 16.0 or later. On earlier versions, it does nothing to

	/// - Parameters:
	///   - chargeOffer: The charge offer that should be resolved. This must be part of the provided
	/// charge site.
	/// - Returns: A view that presents a modal that handles payment and charging for a specific
	/// charge point.

	/// Presents a modal view showing a charge offer detail view where users can start a new in-app
	/// charge session. Its presentation is controlled by the provided binding to a
	/// ``ChargeOfferList`` object.
	///
	/// The modifier checks if all offers have the same site. If they do, the site information
	/// is passed to the detail feature. If offers are from different sites, no site information
	/// is provided.
	/// - Important: This modifier requires iOS 16.0 or later. On earlier versions, it does nothing to
	/// the wrapped view.
	/// - Parameter chargeOfferList: The binding to a ``ChargeOfferList`` object.
	/// - Returns: A view that presents a charge offer detail view using the given
	/// ``ChargeOfferList``.
