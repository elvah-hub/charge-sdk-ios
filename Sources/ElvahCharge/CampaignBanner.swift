import SwiftUI

/// A view that shows promotional charging deals near a given location or inside a map region.
///
/// To show a ``CampaignBanner`` view, you need an instance of a ``CampaignSource``, which is a
/// property wrapper that you can add to any SwiftUI view. A campaign source is responsible for
/// controlling how and when the data for a ``CampaignBanner`` view is loaded. Its projected value
/// (`$`-prefixed property) gives you an optional binding that you can conditionally unwrap and
/// initialize the ``CampaignBanner`` with. The binding will provide the banner with all required
/// information and will trigger internal state updates as needed. Furthermore, a setup like this
/// allows the ``CampaignBanner`` view to control its own presentation in the view hierarchy.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Demo: View {
/// 	@CampaignSource private var campaignSource
///
/// 	var body: some View {
/// 		// ... Your view content
///
/// 		if let $campaignSource {
/// 			CampaignBanner(source: $campaignSource)
/// 		}
/// 	}
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Load a Campaign
///
/// When you want to load a campaign, you set your campaign source to a location or map
/// region:
///
/// ```swift
/// campaignSource = .remote(near: myLocation) // CLLocationCoordinate2D
/// // Or
/// campaignSource = .remote(in: someRegion) // MKMapRect
/// ```
///
/// This will cause the ``CampaignBanner`` to automatically fetch and show an appropriate
/// campaign. Once that campaign expires, the component will attempt to load another campaign from
/// the source and show it. If that fails, the ``CampaignBanner`` will either show a "no deals
/// found" message or remove itself from the view hierarchy, depending on the specified display
/// behavior in the source object.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Hide banner when no campaign is available
/// @CampaignSource(display: .whenContentAvailable) private var campaignSource
/// ```
///
/// ## Reset Banner
///
/// To reset the banner, set its source to `nil`:
///
/// ```swift
/// campaignSource = nil
/// ```
///
/// ## Animation
///
/// To animate the presentation and internal state changes of a ``CampaignBanner`` view, you can
/// pass the campaign source to an `.animation` view modifier like this:
///
/// ```swift
/// .animation(.default, value: campaignSource)
/// ```
///
/// ## Button Configuration
/// ### Variant
///
/// You can configure the button's size via its ``CampaignBanner/variant(_:)`` modifier:
///
/// ```swift
/// CampaignBanner(source: $campaignSource)
/// 	.variant(.compact) // Defaults to .large
/// ```
///
/// ## Full Example
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Demo: View {
/// 	@CampaignSource private var campaignSource
/// 	var body: some View {
/// 		ScrollView {
/// 			VStack {
/// 				Button("Deals Nearby") {
/// 					let myLocation = /* ... */
/// 					campaignSource = .remote(near: myLocation)
/// 				}
/// 				if let $campaignSource {
/// 					CampaignBanner(source: $campaignSource)
/// 				}
/// 			}
/// 			.padding()
/// 			.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
/// 			.animation(.default, value: campaignSource)
/// 		}
/// 	}
/// }
/// ```
