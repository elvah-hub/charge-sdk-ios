# ``ElvahCharge``

`ElvahCharge` is a lightweight toolkit that enables apps to discover nearby EV charging deals and initiate charge sessions through a fully native and seamless interface.

With just a few lines of code, you can add a `ChargeBanner` view to your app that intelligently finds and displays nearby charging deals. The SDK handles everything from deal discovery to payment processing and charge session management, allowing your users to charge their cars without ever leaving your app.
