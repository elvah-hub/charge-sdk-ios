# ``ElvahCharge``

`ElvahCharge` is a lightweight toolkit that enables apps to discover nearby EV charge offers and initiate charging sessions through a fully native and seamless interface.

With just a few lines of code, you can add a `ChargeBanner` view to your app that intelligently finds and displays nearby charge offers. The SDK handles everything from offer discovery to payment processing and charge session management, allowing your users to charge their cars without ever leaving your app.
